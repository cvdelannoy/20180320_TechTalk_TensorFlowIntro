# TensorFlow and you: a very incomplete intro to neural networks
### carloss de Lannoy - March 21st 2018

This repository contains slides and additional material for an introduction to neural networks and their implementation in TensorFlow. though as the name suggests, lots of very important topics have remained untouched. This repository contains a few resources that I was not able to show during the presentation:
* animals.ipynb: a jupyter notebook with an example of a feed-forward neural network
* the video on Blakemore's cats, which (like your convolutional neural network might be) did not detect horizontal stripes if they only ever saw vertical stripes and vice versa: https://youtu.be/QzkMo45pcUo
* playground.tensorflow.org: a beautiful in-browser toy example to explore the workings of a feed-forward neural network.
